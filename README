This driver adds support for W83627EHF and variants, including NCT6775F and
NCT6776F, the linux kernel. It replaces the standard w83627ehf driver.

To build and install this driver, execute the following command sequence:

$ make
$ sudo make install

If you get an error message such as

make: *** /usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.32-32-server: No such file or directory.
Stop.
make: *** [modules] Error 2

you will have to install the correct version of the linux header files. In
Ubuntu, and with above error message, this would be

sudo apt-get install linux-headers-2.6.32-32-server
